Task Instructions:

1. You are provided with three Kubernetes YAML files:
   - deployment.yaml: A Deployment for an nginx application.
   - service.yaml: A Service to expose the application.
   - deprecated-ingress.yaml: An Ingress resource using a deprecated API version (extensions/v1beta1).

2. Your tasks:
   a. Update the Ingress YAML file (deprecated-ingress.yaml) to use the current API version (networking.k8s.io/v1).
   b. Update any required fields in the Ingress spec to conform to the new API version requirements.
   c. Deploy the updated resources into your Kubernetes cluster.
   d. Use the provided bash script (check.sh) to verify that the Ingress resource is using the updated API version.

3. Additional Requirements:
   - Ensure that the Service referenced by the Ingress is correct.
   - Verify that traffic is routed correctly through the Ingress to your application.

Good luck!
